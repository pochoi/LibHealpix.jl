This collection of scripts is intended to simplify the process of distributing pre-built binaries of
LibHealpix.jl's dependencies.

You should be able to just run `./build_in_docker.sh` and the shared libraries will eventually show
up in this directory. Then upload those files to bintray using `./upload_to_bintray.sh`.

Don't forget to publish the files when everything is ready by going to
https://bintray.com/mweastwood/LibHealpix.jl

Finally make sure to update the SHA checksum and URL in the build.jl script.
